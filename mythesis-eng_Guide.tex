This \LaTeX~thesis template follows the standard thesis submission guidelines of Korea University of Technology and Education \cite{ThesisGuide}.

To compile this \LaTeX~thesis template, it is required to use the class file \verb|koreatechthesis.cls|, which implements the official thesis format of KoreaTech \cite{ThesisTemplate}.
This class file must be located in the same folder as the TeX base file \verb|mythesis-eng.tex|. 
The correct output will be generated when the compilation is performed from the TeX base file.

To provide an example of efficient thesis management, this template organizes each chapter in a separate \verb|*.tex| file using the \verb|\include| command.
For instance, Chapter \ref{chap:Guide} is written in \verb|mythesis-eng_Guide.tex|, allowing for organized and modular chapter-wise file management.

\section{Document Formatting and documentclass}	\label{sec:Guide_Documentclass}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The TeX base file \verb|mythesis-eng.tex| begins with the \verb|\documentclass{korea| \verb|techthesis}| command.
The class file \verb|koreatechthesis.cls| is designed to accept three categories of options.
In terms of language, it allows the use of either the \verb|kor| or \verb|eng| option.
For example, to write your thesis in English, the command should be written as \verb|\documentclass[eng]{koreatechthesis}|.
The remaining two types of options will be explained in the following subsections.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{oneside vs. twoside}	\label{sec:Guide_Documentclass_SideOption}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

When the \verb|twoside| option is specified in the class file, that is, \verb|\documentclass| \verb|[twoside,eng]{koreatechthesis}|, it follows the conventional typesetting practices used in printed books.
In most commercially published books, chapters and tables of contents typically begin on odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.
Consequently, the even-numbered page preceding a new chapter may sometimes appear as a blank page, depending on the layout of the previous chapter.
The \verb|twoside| option precisely follows this convention. 
If you intend to print your final thesis double-sided, then enable this option.
For clarity, consider Chapter \ref{chap:Guide} in this template --- its preceding page is a blank page under the \verb|twoside| option.
Another examples can be found in the front matter of this template, where all even-numbered pages appear as blank pages.
If you imagine printing this file double-sided, then the reason for this formatting will become clear.

To print single-sided, the \verb|oneside| option may be used. 
In this case, all blank pages that would appear with the \verb|twoside| option are removed.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{bfive vs. afour}	\label{sec:Guide_Documentclass_PaperOption}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section explains the \verb|bfive| and \verb|afour| options.
According to the official thesis guidelines \cite{ThesisGuide}, the final version of your thesis must be printed on B5 size paper ($182 \times 257\,{\rm mm}$)%
\footnote{%
	The size of A4 paper appears to be standardized internationally.
	It conforms to the ISO international standard, with dimensions of $210 \times 297\,{\rm mm}$.
	In contrast, the situation is different for B5 paper.
	In Korea, most of the publishing industry seems to follow the Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) which defines B5 paper as $182 \times 257\,{\rm mm}$.
	Unfortunately, \LaTeX~adheres to the ISO international standard under which B5 paper measures $176 \times 250\,{\rm mm}$.
	This \LaTeX~template is configured to use the JIS standard B5 paper size in accordance with \cite{ThesisGuide}.
}.
To produce it in B5 format, the \verb|bfive| option should be used.
Note however that while generating a PDF with this option presents no issues, printing on physical papers requires a printer that supports B5 paper size and has B5 sheets loaded in its tray.

Since most people print on A4 paper, the \verb|afour| option is also provided for convenience.
When the \verb|afour| option is specified in \verb|koreatechthesis.cls|, the output is generated with dimensions that precisely match those of standard A4 paper.
This means it can be printed easily on most commonly available printers.
However, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:B5vsA4}, the actual content is confined to the gray B5-sized area centered on the A4 page.
Therefore, even though you switch back and forth between the \verb|bfive| and \verb|afour| options, the layout of your content --- such as equations, figures, and tables --- will remain unchanged.
So, feel free to switch between the two options whenever necessary.

The following is a summary of Sections \ref{sec:Guide_Documentclass_SideOption} and \ref{sec:Guide_Documentclass_PaperOption}.

\begin{thm}	\label{thm:ClassOptions}
	Regarding to this \LaTeX~template, if you intend to print
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	the final version of your thesis for \emph{double-sided} printing, then use\\
				\verb|\documentclass[bfive,twoside,eng]{koreatechthesis}|
		\item 	the final version of your thesis for \emph{single-sided} printing, then use\\
				\verb|\documentclass[bfive,oneside,eng]{koreatechthesis}|
		\item 	an intermediate draft for review purposes, then use\\
				\verb|\documentclass[afour,twoside,eng]{koreatechthesis}|\\
				or \verb|\documentclass[afour,oneside,eng]{koreatechthesis}|
	\end{itemize}	
	Options other than these are not supported.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	The proof of Theorem \ref{thm:ClassOptions} is omitted.

\section{Miscellaneous}	\label{sec:Guide_Etc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section briefly introduces a few notes related to this \LaTeX~template.
First, if your thesis has a subtitle, then you can use the \verb|\subtitle| command in the preamble of the TeX base file \verb|mythesis-eng.tex|.
If it has no subtitle, simply leave the argument of \verb|\subtitle| empty --- that is, write it as \verb|\subtitle{}|.

The approval page, which contains the signatures of the committee members, is designed to require \emph{handwritten names and signatures} from each committee member.
In accordance with the university regulations, the number of committee members, including the chair, must be no fewer than three and no more than five.
Therefore, this template is constructed to allow flexible adjustment of the number of committee members according to the actual composition of the committee.
Indeed, by specifying an appropriate integer as the argument of \verb|\numberofcommitteemembers| in the preamble of the TeX base file \verb|mythesis-eng.tex|, signature fields for that number of committee members (including the chair) will be generated.
A more precise description is given below.
\begin{lem}
	Let $n$ be the integer you specified as the argument of the command \verb|\numberofcommitteemembers|.
	Then, the signature fields for
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item 	three committee members if $n < 3$,
		\item 	five committee members if $n > 5$, and
		\item 	exactly $n$ committee members otherwise
	\end{enumerate}
	will be generated on the approval page.
\end{lem}

Chapters and sections are structured using the commands \verb|\chapter| and \verb|\section|, respectively.
The section depth can go down to the subsubsection level.
In other words, the hierarchy of chapters and sections supported by this \LaTeX~template is as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
	\chapter
	\section
	\subsection
	\subsubsection
\end{verbatim}
However, according to \cite{ThesisGuide} and the official university template \cite{ThesisTemplate} based on it, titles created using \verb|\subsubsection| are not included in the Table of Contents.
Accordingly, this \LaTeX~template is designed to include only up to the \verb|\subsection| level in the Table of Contents.

In the preamble of \verb|mythesis-eng.tex|, the \verb|\newtheorem| command is used to define new environments for theorems and definitions.
In this setup, the numbering for the environments is based on the chapter level.
If you prefer to number them by section instead, you can simply change the option \verb|chapter| to \verb|section|.

This \LaTeX~template uses the \verb|hyperref| package.
As a result, red and green boxes are generated in the output PDF, and clicking these boxes will correctly navigate to the linked locations.
Of course, these boxes are not printed when the PDF is sent to a physical printer.

% This \LaTeX~template does not enforce a particular style for the bibliography.
% Therefore, you should write the \verb|thebibliography| section in \verb|mythesis-eng.tex| as specified in \cite{ThesisGuide}.

The unofficial template can use a .bib file like \cite{2024RN790combo}.
